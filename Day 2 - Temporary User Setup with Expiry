As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named ammar requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do: Create a user named ammar on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-01-28, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.
To accomplish this task on App Server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter, you’ll need to log in to the server and run the appropriate Linux user management command. Here’s the exact step-by-step process:

✅ Steps to Create Temporary User ammar
1.	Access App Server 3 Use SSH to connect:
bash
ssh banner@<app-server-3-ip>
(Replace <app-server-3-ip> with the actual IP or hostname of App Server 3.)

2.	Create the user ammar with expiry date Run the following command:
bash
sudo useradd -e 2024-01-28 ammar
o	-e specifies the account expiry date.
o	ammar is lowercase, following protocol.

3.	Set a password for the user
bash
sudo passwd ammar
(You’ll be prompted to enter and confirm a password.)

4.	Verify the account expiry
bash
sudo chage -l ammar
Look for:
Code
Account expires : Jan 28, 2024

🔒 Notes
•	After 2024-01-28, the account will automatically be disabled.
•	If you need to extend or modify the expiry later, you can use:
bash
sudo usermod -e YYYY-MM-DD ammar

Doubts: what is sudo and -l
Great question — let’s break it down clearly:
🖥️ What is sudo?
•	sudo stands for “superuser do”.
•	It lets a regular user run commands with administrative (root) privileges.
•	Many system management tasks (like adding users, changing passwords, modifying system files) require elevated permissions.
•	Example:
bash
sudo useradd ammar
Here, sudo ensures you have the rights to create a new user.
📄 What is the -l option in chage?
•	chage is a command used to view or change user password expiry information.
•	The -l option means “list”.
•	It displays the account’s password aging and expiry details.
•	Example:
bash
sudo chage -l ammar
This will show information like:
o	Last password change
o	Password expiry
o	Account expiry (the date you set, e.g., Jan 28, 2024)
o	Warning period before expiry
✅ Putting it Together
•	sudo → gives you permission to run admin-level commands.
•	chage -l → lists the expiry and password details for a user account.
