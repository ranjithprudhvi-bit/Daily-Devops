In a bid to automate backup processes, the xFusionCorp Industries sysadmin team has developed a new bash script named xfusioncorp.sh. While the script has been distributed to all necessary servers, it lacks executable permissions on App Server 1 within the Stratos Datacenter.

Your task is to grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 1. Additionally, ensure that all users have the capability to execute it.


Below is a complete, clear, and exam-/interview-ready solution with exact commands, detailed explanations, and a LinkedIn success post as requested.

🎯 Task Objective
On App Server 3 (stapp03) in the Stratos Datacenter:
•	Grant executable permission to the script
👉 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
•	Ensure all users (owner, group, others) can execute it
________________________________________
🖥️ Target Server Details
Server	IP	User	Purpose
stapp03	172.16.238.12	banner	Nautilus App Server 3
________________________________________
✅ Step-by-Step Commands with Detailed Explanation
________________________________________
1️⃣ Connect to App Server 3 using SSH
ssh banner@172.16.238.12
🔍 Explanation
•	ssh → Secure Shell protocol to access remote servers
•	banner → Non-root user provided for App Server 3
•	172.16.238.12 → IP address of stapp03
•	Enter password when prompted: BigGr33n
________________________________________
2️⃣ Check Current Permissions of the Script (Recommended)
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
🔍 Explanation
•	ls -l → Displays long listing including file permissions
•	Helps confirm that the script is not executable
❌ Example Output (Before)
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
➡️ No x permission means the script cannot be executed
________________________________________
3️⃣ Grant Execute Permission to All Users
chmod a+x /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
🔍 Explanation
•	chmod → Change file permissions
•	a → All users (owner, group, others)
•	+x → Add execute permission
•	Result: Anyone on the system can execute the script
________________________________________
4️⃣ Verify Updated Permissions
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
✅ Expected Output (After)
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
🔍 Explanation
•	x for owner → executable
•	x for group → executable
•	x for others → executable
•	Task requirement fully met ✅
________________________________________
5️⃣ (Optional) Execute the Script to Confirm
/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
🔍 Explanation
•	Confirms the script runs without permission issues

🎉 Final Outcome
✔ Executable permission successfully added
✔ All users can execute the backup script
✔ Automation requirement satisfied
✔ Linux permission best practices applied
