The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting, they have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below complete the task: a. Install tomcat server on App Server 1. b. Configure it to run on port 5000. c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp. Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e curl http://stapp01:5000

Tomcat Installation & Java Application Deployment on App Server 1
________________________________________
1️⃣ Task Objective
The Nautilus application development team required deployment of a Java-based web application using Apache Tomcat on App Server 1 (stapp01) in the Stratos Datacenter.
🔹 Requirements
•	Install Apache Tomcat
•	Configure Tomcat to run on port 5000
•	Deploy ROOT.war from Jump Host
•	Ensure application is accessible on base URL:
•	http://stapp01:5000
________________________________________
2️⃣ Environment Details
Component	Details
App Server	stapp01
OS Type	RHEL/CentOS based
Application Server	Apache Tomcat
Java Version	OpenJDK 11
Deployment File	ROOT.war
Access Method	Jump Host
________________________________________
3️⃣ Step-by-Step Implementation
Step 1: Access App Server
•	Logged into Jump Host
•	SSH’d into stapp01
•	Switched to root for administrative tasks
✔ Required for package installation and configuration changes
________________________________________
Step 2: Java Installation
•	Installed OpenJDK 11 (Tomcat dependency)
•	Verified Java installation using java -version
✔ Java runtime confirmed
________________________________________
Step 3: Apache Tomcat Installation
•	Installed Tomcat using package manager
•	Verified Tomcat directory structure
✔ Tomcat installed successfully
________________________________________
Step 4: Port Configuration (8080 → 5000)
•	Located Tomcat configuration using:
•	whereis tomcat
•	Identified /etc/tomcat as configuration directory
•	Edited server.xml
•	Changed connector port from 8080 to 5000
✔ Port updated correctly
________________________________________
Step 5: Tomcat Service Management
•	Started Tomcat service
•	Enabled Tomcat to start on boot
•	Verified service status
✔ Tomcat running under tomcat user (non-root)
________________________________________
Step 6: Application Deployment
•	Copied ROOT.war from Jump Host to App Server
•	Moved WAR file to:
•	/usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
•	Set correct ownership (tomcat:tomcat)
•	Restarted Tomcat for deployment
✔ Application auto-deployed by Tomcat
________________________________________
Step 7: Verification
•	Tested application using:
•	curl http://stapp01:5000
•	Received valid HTML response
✔ Application accessible on base URL
✔ Deployment successful

4️⃣ Issues Faced, Mistakes & Questions Asked
❌ Issue 1: Unable to Edit server.xml
Error:
E505: "/etc/tomcat/server.xml" is read-only
Cause:
•	File opened without proper write permissions
Solution:
•	Reopened file using root privileges:
•	sudo vi /etc/tomcat/server.xml
________________________________________
❌ Issue 2: Confusion About Tomcat Configuration Path
Question Asked:
“From whereis tomcat, how do I know where server.xml is?”
Cause:
•	Multiple Tomcat-related directories returned
Solution:
•	Identified /etc/tomcat as configuration directory
•	Confirmed presence of server.xml using ls and find
________________________________________
❌ Issue 3: Confusion Between /usr/share/tomcat/conf and /etc/tomcat
Question Asked:
“How can I open conf?”
Cause:
•	conf is a directory, not a file
•	RHEL-based systems separate config and application files
Solution:
•	Used cd to enter directory
•	Learned that /etc/tomcat is the active config location
________________________________________
❌ Issue 4: Concern About Running Tomcat as Root
Question Asked:
“Tomcat should be run by a user, not by root, right?”
Clarification:
•	Root is used only for installation and configuration
•	Tomcat service runs as tomcat user via systemd
Verification:
ps -ef | grep tomcat
✔ Security best practice followed
________________________________________
❌ Issue 5: Understanding systemctl start vs enable
Question Asked:
“What do these commands do?”
Clarification:
•	start → starts service immediately
•	enable → ensures service starts on reboot
✔ Correct usage confirmed
________________________________________
5️⃣ Final Validation Output
curl http://stapp01:5000
Output:
<h2>Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!</h2>
✔ Confirms application is live and accessible

6️⃣ Final Status
Task	Status
Tomcat Installed	✅
Port Changed to 5000	✅
Application Deployed	✅
Base URL Accessible	✅
Security Best Practices	✅
________________________________________
7️⃣ Key Learnings
•	How to locate configuration files using whereis and find
•	Difference between application directories and config directories
•	Importance of running services as non-root users
•	Correct Tomcat deployment workflow
•	Real-world troubleshooting of permission and configuration issues
________________________________________
8️⃣ Conclusion
The task was successfully completed following Linux and DevOps best practices. All issues encountered were resolved through systematic troubleshooting and verification. The Java web application is now running correctly on Apache Tomcat and accessible via the required base URL.
